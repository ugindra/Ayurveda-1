            <h1>Hair Strengthen</h1>
            <h3>Hibiscus Flower Extract</h3>
            <li>
                Hibiscus is a multi-colored, commonly found flowering plant It is rich in amino acids,
                 vitamins A and C, and alpha hydroxy acids, among other things,
                  all of which are ideal for promoting hair growth and preventing hair loss.
                   Collect and dice about 20 red flowers and four thick leaves.
                    Take a frying pan and add 100 ml of any hair oil (you can pick one from our list of the best carrier oils!) Add the minced flowers and leaves to the oil and gently heat until fumes appear.
                     For added potency, you can add 4-5 leaves of basil with a pinch of fenugreek. Switch off the flame and allow the mixture to settle in for 2-3 days.
                      Filter and store in a glass bottle. Apply this oil by gently massaging it into the scalp and wait for an hour before showering.
                       (Preferably using a natural, gentle shampoo to wash off the oil). Not only will the oil strengthen hair and add the shine of your dreams, but it will also aid in hair growth.
